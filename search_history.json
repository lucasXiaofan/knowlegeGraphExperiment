    "query": "Hi Support Team,\n\nI get the message below after Pairing Successfully from my Visual Studio on my Windows Laptop:\nThe Xcode version installed on the Mac (15.4) is not compatible with this version of Visual Studio. This may cause unexpected warnings or errors when building and deploying iOS projects. Please install Xcode '16.0'. To download a specific version of Xcode, visit: https://developer.apple.com/downloads. If multiple versions of Xcode are installed on the Mac, you may specify which version to use under Tools -> Options -> Xamarin -> iOS Settings\n\nSimilarly, when trying to run the iOS Emulator, it subsequently errored with the following:\n \nThis version of Microsoft.iOS requires the iOS 18.0 SDK (shipped with Xcode 16.0). Either upgrade Xcode to get the required header files or set the managed linker behaviour to Link Framework SDKs Only in your project's iOS Build Options > Linker Behavior (to try to avoid the new APIs)\n\nThe recommended Xcode version for Microsoft.iOS 18.0.8303 is Xcode 16.0 or later. The current Xcode version (found in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer) is 15.4. \n\nIs this something you can help with?\n\nRegards\nSamson",
